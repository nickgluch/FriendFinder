Deployed Heroku link - https://thawing-sands-54422.herokuapp.com/

This app starts the user on a home page and allows them to navigate to a survey page in which they answer personality questions along with their name and photo. 
Once they submit thier information, the app finds the most compatible user based on how much of a difference there is between other users and the current user's answers to the questions. The user with the smallest difference is the most compatible user and gets shown as a module to the current user with the match's name and photo.
